            <h2>Welcome to My HPT Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
              This website is meant to serve as a comprehensive resource for
              students, scholars, and professionals interested in exploring the
              field of Human Performance Technology. Through my academic journey
              and practical experience, I have developed a deep appreciation for
              the systematic approach that HPT provides in addressing
              performance gaps and enhancing organizational effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that HPT represents the future of performance
              improvement, combining scientific rigor with practical application
              to create meaningful change in individuals and organizations. My
              particular interest in technology in education has deepened my
              appreciation for how innovative tools and digital solutions can
              enhance learning outcomes and streamline performance
              interventions. My commitment to this field drives me to
              continuously learn, research, and share knowledge with the broader
              HPT community, especially exploring how emerging educational
              technologies can advance human performance in both academic and
              workplace settings.

          <h3>What HPT Means to Me</h3>
          <p>
            Human Performance Technology represents more than just a
            professional discipline—it embodies a systematic, evidence-based
            approach to understanding and improving human performance in all its
            complexity. To me, HPT is about bridging the gap between theory and
            practice, using rigorous analysis to identify performance barriers
            and implementing interventions that create lasting, positive change.
          </p>

          <p>
            The field resonates with me because it combines scientific
            methodology with human-centered design, recognizing that performance
            improvement isn't just about processes or technology—it's about
            people. HPT provides the framework to understand performance
            holistically, considering environmental, motivational, and systemic
            factors that influence human behavior and outcomes. This
            comprehensive approach ensures that interventions address root
            causes rather than symptoms, leading to sustainable performance
            improvements.

        <h2>About This Website and Its Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio website serves as a comprehensive resource for
          understanding Human Performance Technology and its applications. The
          site was developed as part of my academic coursework and professional
          development in HPT, designed to serve students, scholars, and
          professionals interested in exploring this dynamic field.
        </p>

        <p>
          The website is organized into four main sections, each addressing key
          aspects of HPT knowledge and practice:
