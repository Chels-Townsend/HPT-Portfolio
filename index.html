            <h2>Welcome to My HPT Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome students, scholars, and professionals, to the All About
              HPT portfolio website, a site dedicated to the field of Human
              Performance Technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              HPT provides the scientific basis for identifying and developing
              improvement at the individual and organizational level. We can all
              strive to be better than yesterday, and HPT gives us the tools and
              resources to plan, organize, and enact positive change.
            </p>
            <p>
              My personal interest in technology in education is further driven
              by the idea that technology can have a positive impact inside and
              outside of the classroom. Together, let's discover how emerging
              technologies can advance human performance in academic and
              professional settings!

          <h3>What HPT Means to Me</h3>
          <p>
            To me, Human Performance Technology studies the intersection of
            work, knowledge, and motivation, and the ways that we can affect
            these disciplines. HPT frameworks give us the ability to understand
            performance holistically by considering the internal and external
            factors that influence behaviors and outcomes.

        <h2>About This Website and Its Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio website serves as a comprehensive resource for
          understanding Human Performance Technology and its applications. The
          site was developed as part of my academic coursework and professional
          development in HPT, designed to serve students, scholars, and
          professionals interested in exploring this dynamic field.
        </p>

        <p>
          The website is organized into four main sections, each addressing key
          aspects of HPT knowledge and practice:

                including detailed explanations of Gilbert's Behavior
                Engineering Model, Rummler-Brache Performance Model, and
                additional models, all described in original language with
                practical applications.
