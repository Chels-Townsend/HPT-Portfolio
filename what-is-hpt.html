        <h1>What is Human Performance Technology?</h1>

        <h2>Definition of HPT</h2>
        <p>
          Human Performance Technology (HPT) is the systematic process of
          identifying performance gaps and implementing interventions to achieve
          performance improvements by increasing productivity, improving
          quality, or reacting to business opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
          HPT practitioners use a systematic process to identify performance
          gaps, analyze their causes, and recommend interventions that will
          close those gaps while considering the organizational context,
          constraints, and desired outcomes. The field emphasizes evidence-based
          practice and measurable results, making it a valuable approach for
          organizations seeking to improve their human capital effectiveness.
        </p>

        <h2>International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI)</h2>
        <p>
          The International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI) is the
          leading professional association for HPT practitioners worldwide.
          Founded in 1962, ISPI is dedicated to improving individual,
          organizational, and societal performance through the application of
          performance technology principles and practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          ISPI serves as the premier resource for HPT professionals, providing
          certification programs, research publications, professional
          development opportunities, and networking events. The organization
          maintains the highest standards for HPT practice through its
          certification programs and continues to advance the field through
          research and knowledge sharing.
        </p>

        <h2>ISPI Standards</h2>
        <p>
          ISPI has established comprehensive standards that define the
          knowledge, skills, and competencies required for effective HPT
          practice. These standards are organized into several key areas. Click

            <h3>Performance Analysis Standards</h3>
            <p>
              These standards focus on the systematic analysis of performance
              gaps, including the ability to conduct needs assessments, cause
              analysis, and environmental analysis. Practitioners must
              demonstrate competency in identifying performance problems and
              their root causes.
